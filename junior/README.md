# DevOps Engineer Homework

This starter contains three intentional issues. Allow approximately one hour
to troubleshoot them, verify your changes, and submit your work.

## Requirements

- Bash on Linux, macOS, WSL, or Git Bash on Windows.
- Git and a GitHub account with permission to run GitHub Actions.
- No cloud account, credentials, or additional packages are needed.

Run the commands below from the repository root in Bash.

## Task 1: Fix a failing script (15 minutes)

```bash
bash task-1-script/random-data.sh
```

Correct the failure and explain what the script is doing.

## Task 2: Resolve a configuration issue (15 minutes)

```bash
bash task-2-configuration/show-service.sh
```

This script runs from the repository root but fails from another directory.
Make it work regardless of the caller's working directory. Successful runs
must print `Service: sample-worker` and `Environment: test`.

To reproduce the other-directory behavior:

```bash
repo_root="$(pwd)"
(cd .. && bash "$repo_root/task-2-configuration/show-service.sh")
```

Also verify that a missing configuration produces a useful error and a nonzero
exit code. Restore the configuration after testing.

## Task 3: Repair the automated check (20 minutes)

Review `.github/workflows/check-scripts.yml` and the GitHub Actions logs.
Fix the workflow so both corrected scripts run successfully. Keep the push
and pull request triggers, and ensure a script failure fails the workflow.

## Submission (10 minutes)

- Create your own repository from this starter, or fork it if permitted.
- Make your fixes on a branch, commit and push them, and open a pull request
  against your repository's default branch. Leave it open for review.
- Add a short findings section to this README describing each issue, how you
  identified it, your fix, and the commands or checks used to verify it.
- Provide your repository URL, pull request URL, and a successful Actions run
  URL. For private repositories, grant reviewers access.
- Do not include credentials, secrets, or employer information.

Stop after approximately one hour. If anything remains unresolved, submit
your progress, what you tried, and what you would investigate next.

# Findings
## Task 1
Line 8 needed the variables to be references properly using $ 
In lines 10,12 and 13 there were typos in the commands.

## Task 2
Added a line to find the location of the service.conf. As it is in the same directory of the script, it gets the script directory and set the path to the service.conf. So it will load it eveytime is executed. Nonzero error validation kept as it was.

## Task 3
Changed service.conf file type from Windows to Linux to convert line endings and fix error
